[I used Markdown to make this résumé.](https://github.com/thcipriani/hireme/blob/master/README.md)

I use Markdown in Vim for writing.

Todo lists, notes, blogging, meeting notes—whatever. Strewn across a
variety of Rsync'd machines, inside GitHub repos and gists, and on S3 and
various NFS stores—this is how I manage on a day-to-day.

Ever since I started using [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) (which
is software written in Haskell by [John McFarlane](http://john.macfarlane.usesthis.com/))
I've started finding _even more_ uses for Markdown. My résumé is one such
use case.

I also found some good resources:

* [Nathaniel Welch's résumé](https://github.com/icco/Resume/blob/master/resume.md)
* [Sysadvent](http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2011/12/day-14-write-your-resume-in-markdown.html)
